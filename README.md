# iverilog Simple Simulation
---
Verilog test benches using iverilog waveform using gtkwave.  
These are the simulation files that are generated by iverilog.
---
The following <a href="https://medium.com/macoclock/running-verilog-code-on-linux-mac-3b06ddcccc55">tutorial</a> was used to generate this git repository.

This set of files will be used as future reference for using verilog.
